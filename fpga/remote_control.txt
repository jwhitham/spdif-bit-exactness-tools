 15 downto 14 set the command
   00 = do nothing
   01 = set mode
     7 pre-emphasis bit
       0 = do nothing
       1 = set
         6 -> pre-emphasis bit value (0 or 1)
     2 mode set (enable remote control)

       1 = set
         6 downto 3 -> mode setting value
         0000  CX  compress max -> maximum volume
         0001  C2  compress 2 -> volume set by adjust 2
         0010  C1  compress 1 -> volume set by adjust 1
         0011  A2  no compression, volume set by adjust 2
         0100  CV  compress for video -> volume set by adjust 2
         0101  P   passthrough
         (others are for debug - see mode_definitions.vhdl)

The comfilter module receives the commands using frequency shift
keying at 300 baud. The commands are encoded as sound by
compressor_remote.exe. The commands are sent via UDP by
compressor_remote.py.
